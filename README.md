# Youth Soccer Club Locator

This is a web application that I made that allows users to find youth soccer clubs all around the U.S. You can filter club rsesults by State, League and Location where users can specify a radius of either 10, 20, 50 or 100 miles. The tech stack of this website is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To implement the location filter feature I utilized the geolocation API and used the haversine function to calculate distances between the user and clubs.

# Future Features
- There are currently only 3 youth soccer leagues in this web application (MLS Next, ECNL, USL Academy) and in the future I plan to add other nationwide leagues such as NAL, Elite Academy, ECNL R, and NPL
- I plan to add U.S youth girls Leagues such as GA, ECNL Girls and DPL
- As you can see in the navigation bar on the website there are other pages that I plan to create. I want this to be a fully functional website that provides users with all the necessary information about soccer in the United States
